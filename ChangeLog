	* Version: 0.1.0
	
	This is the first release of aPAz, A Php AnonymiZer. 

	aPAz already supports HTTP protocol, HTML GET/POST forms and cookies.
	Also "One Time" encryption is applied on page links. However neither 
	frames nor pages containing strange/complex javascript code are yet 
	well supported, and some Web sites will not work.
